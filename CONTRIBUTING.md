## How can you help to bring more fun into R?
***

**Find and link fun stuff**

At this moment, the core of this project is [a file linking to blog posts](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-r-fun/blob/master/The%20ultimate%20list%20of%20cool%20and%20unorthodox%20examples%20in%20R.md) with R scripts, packages and datasets with fun and unexpected material. You can help out by finding more cool and fun stuff, and adding to the list.

**Help organizing and curating the list**

You can help in the list organization, checking out if links are working, testing the material to see if its up to date with current R version, adding descriptions or anything else you feel that might be useful.

**Creating new material**

Like R and have a lot of cool ideas? We can host new material in the repo - I'm planning to do that myself soon.
