# Teach fun R courses! :D

This repo is a "side project" from the [Open Teach-R project](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project), and was created before [this session](https://guidebook.com/guide/114124/event/16741544/) in [MozFest 2017](mozillafestival.org).

*More info is going to be here soon as te repo gets structured, ok? ;)*

The main idea is to use different, unexpected or completely unorthodox examples of R usage and use them to teach R courses as a way to make it feel more friendly and even cool to learn!
