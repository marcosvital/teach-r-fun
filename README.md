# Teach fun R courses! :D

This repo is a "side project" from the [Open Teach-R project](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project), and was created before [this session](https://guidebook.com/guide/114124/event/16741544/) in [MozFest 2017](mozillafestival.org).

*More info is going to be here soon as te repo gets structured, ok? ;)*

*But please feel free to say hi or ask anything [at the issues tab](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-r-fun/issues). :)*

The main idea is to use different, unexpected or completely unorthodox examples of R usage and use them to teach R courses as a way to make it feel more friendly and even cool to learn!

**What do we have so far (to be constantly update as the project grows):**

- [The ultimate list of cool and unorthodox examples in R](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-r-fun/blob/master/The%20ultimate%20list%20of%20cool%20and%20unorthodox%20examples%20in%20R.md)
- [Slides from MozFest session are here on google docs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fEAvFY4vGtWdQDXU4akZLodbnHZdbz0uCYhLioE3ryE/edit?usp=sharing) (I'll turn them into pdf and save at the repo later, since I'm still editing them).
- Back on the "mother project", I started building [The funniest R course course in the world](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/tree/master/courses/en/Funniest%20R%20course); right now there's only the script for Tie Plots, and I'll probably just bring it to this repo later.
