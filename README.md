**Resources for teaching R using fun and unorthodox examples**

What is the key for learning R? Having a good teacher, following well structured guides, using learning material that is focused on your needs - all this can make a huge difference, as R is known for its steep learning curve (specially for people without programming background). If you have a few or all of those elements at hand, learning it will be much easier... but it can be even better, it can be just plain **fun!**

**About this repo**

This repo was born during a session I facilitated at [MozFest 2017](mozillafestival.org) about Teaching R. It is related to the [Open Teach-R project](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project), but it will work as a stand alone project. And its purpose is simple as that: I want to compile fun, unorthodox or unexpected examples of R functions, packages, tutorials or datasets, so we can all use it for teaching (or for having fun ourselves).

The rationale here is pretty straightforward: as students tackle with subjects that they might perceive as difficult and/or boring, using the unexpected can draw their attention and fuel their interest.


**What do we have so far**

- [The ultimate list of cool and unorthodox examples in R](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-r-fun/blob/master/The%20ultimate%20list%20of%20cool%20and%20unorthodox%20examples%20in%20R.md): this is, at this moment, the core of this project!
- [Slides from MozFest session are here on google docs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fEAvFY4vGtWdQDXU4akZLodbnHZdbz0uCYhLioE3ryE/edit?usp=sharing) and [in a pdf file](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-r-fun/docs/Teach-R-project-mozfest-2017.pdf).
- Back on the "mother project", I started building [The funniest R course course in the world](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/tree/master/courses/en/Funniest%20R%20course); right now there's only the script for Tie Plots, and I'll probably just bring it to this repo later.

**How can you help?**

OK, a contributing file and a code of conduct are coming soon. But if you want to help right now, take a look at the [list here](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-r-fun/blob/master/The%20ultimate%20list%20of%20cool%20and%20unorthodox%20examples%20in%20R.md) and feel free to send any suggestions. You can say hi creating a issue, send me an email at marcosvital at gmail or sending a PR here at GitHub. ;)
